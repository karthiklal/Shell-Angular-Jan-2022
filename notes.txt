Assignment

1. Convert the SalaryCalculatorModel into an ES6 class

2. Given the below products:
    var products = [
        {id : 6, name : 'Pen', cost : 50, units : 20, category : 'stationary'},
        {id : 9, name : 'Ten', cost : 70, units : 70, category : 'stationary'},
        {id : 3, name : 'Len', cost : 60, units : 60, category : 'grocery'},
        {id : 5, name : 'Zen', cost : 30, units : 30, category : 'grocery'},
        {id : 1, name : 'Ken', cost : 20, units : 80, category : 'utencil'},
        {id : 7, name : 'Mouse', cost : 100, units : 20, category : 'electronics'}
    ];

    1. Sort the products by cost (use 'sort()' method and arrow function)
    2. Filter all the stationary products (using 'filter()' method and arrow function)
    3. Print the name and discounted price of each product (use 'forEach()' method and arrow function)
    4. Find the max cost among the products (use 'reduce()' method and arrow function)
    5. Find the total units of all the products (use 'reduce()' method and arrow function)
    6. Find the average cost of all the products (use 'reduce()' method and arrow function)
    8. Group the products by category
